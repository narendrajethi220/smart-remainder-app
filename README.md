* Store API keys and sensitive data in `.env`.
* Split large components into smaller reusable components.
* Use hooks for repeated logic (fetching reminders, notifications).
* Add loading spinners and error handling.
* Implement browser or push notifications.
* Add unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
* Create a theme file for colors, fonts, and spacing.
* Optimize performance with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
* Document functions and components.
